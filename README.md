# CS 390 Group Project Template

This is a starting template for the group project for CS 390, Spring 2021.
It uses the Gradle tool for build and dependency management.

- Place source code in: `src/main/java`
- JUnit tests go in: `src/test/java`
- Gradle configuration: `build.gradle`

To run the JUnit tests:

```
./gradlew test
```

Test results are visible in:

```
build/reports/tests/test/index.html
```

Or, use your IDE to run the tests and view the results directly in 
the IDE.
